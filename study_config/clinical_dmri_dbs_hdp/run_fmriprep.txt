# KUL_Neuro_Imaging_Tools
#  this is the config file for KUL_preproc_all

# Here you specify which subjects to process
#  this is the participant name (can be without 'sub-')
#  separate them by a space
#  KUL_preproc_all checks what has been done already, but this check is rudimentary, thus
#	if a processing step failed or was interupted, 
# 	or you scanned an extra session you need to delete the results and redo processing

BIDS_participants: 


# fmriprep processing
#  options: see the fmriprep documentation
#	in most cases it is useful to set options
#	e.g. --anat_only in case you have no fmri data
#	e.g. --longitudinal when you have multiple session
#  ncpu: don't set iths too high (n<8 is safe)
#  mem: see your docker preferences
#	for anat only, it uses +/- 1 GB per T1w or FLAIR
#	can be much higher if you have e.g. multi-echo resting state fMRI
#  simultaneous: defines how many subjects to process simultaneously (e.g. on the VSC-HPC)
#	if you have x cpu's, set it to x/ncpu
#	but also take into account memory usage: if mem is 1GB per subject and your pc has 8GB of RAM, set to 8 max

# specify here if you want preproc_all to exit after doing mriqc, fmriprep, freesurfer and/or dwiprep
#  i.e. before starting dwiprep_anat
#  this can be usefull if you process data in seperate steps, e.g. on the VSC-HPC
