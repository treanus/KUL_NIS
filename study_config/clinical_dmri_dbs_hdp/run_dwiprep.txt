# KUL_Neuro_Imaging_Tools
#  this is the config file for KUL_preproc_all

# Here you specify which subjects to process
#  this is the participant name (can be without 'sub-')
#  separate them by a space
#  KUL_preproc_all checks what has been done already, but this check is rudimentary, thus
#	if a processing step failed or was interupted, 
# 	or you scanned an extra session you need to delete the results and redo processing

BIDS_participants: 

# dwiprep processing
#  options: look at the our webpage (in most cases leaving empty is fine)
#  synbzero_disco_instead_of_topup: 1 for using it (see webpage)
#  rev_phase_for_topup_only: 1 for using the rev_phase images only for topup
#  ncpu: numer of cpu's to use for each subject 
#  simultaneous: defines how many subjects to process simultaneously
do_dwiprep: 1
dwiprep_options: dhollander
synbzero_disco_instead_of_topup: 0
rev_phase_for_topup_only: 1

dwiprep_simultaneous: 1


# specify here if you want preproc_all to exit after doing mriqc, fmriprep, freesurfer and/or dwiprep
#  i.e. before starting dwiprep_anat
#  this can be usefull if you process data in seperate steps, e.g. on the VSC-HPC
