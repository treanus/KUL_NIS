# Here you specify which subjects to process
#  this is the participant name (can be without 'sub-')
#  separate them by a space
#  KUL_preproc_all checks what has been done already, but this check is rudimentary, thus
#	if a processing step failed or was interupted, 
# 	or you scanned an extra session you need to delete the results and redo processing

BIDS_participants: 


# Freesurfer processing
# options: look at the our webpage (in most cases leaving empty is fine)
# ncpu: numer of cpu's to use for each subject
# (a minimum of 2 is recommended;
# going high > 4 is not recommended since most processes are not parallelised anyway)
# simultaneous: defines how many subjects to process simultaneously
# (if you have x cpu's, set it to x/ncpu)
# (but also take into account memory usage: about 2GB per subject, so if your pc has 16GB of RAM, set to 8 max)
# note: with ncpu=2, freesurfer takes about 10 hours

# specify here if you want preproc_all to exit after doing mriqc, fmriprep, freesurfer and/or dwiprep
#  i.e. before starting dwiprep_anat
#  this can be usefull if you process data in seperate steps, e.g. on the VSC-HPC
